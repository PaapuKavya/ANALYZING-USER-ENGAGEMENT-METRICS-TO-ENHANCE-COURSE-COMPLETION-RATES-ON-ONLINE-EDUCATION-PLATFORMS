# ANALYZING USER ENGAGEMENT METRICS TO ENHANCE COURSE COMPLETION RATES ON ONLINE EDUCATION PLATFORMS

To examine user engagement metrics and their impact on course completion rates, a detailed data analysis technique is employed, utilizing Python as well as its highly effective data analysis collec-tions. This section provides an outline of the data analysis techniques as well as devices made use of, together with the purpose for selecting Python and its own public libraries.

# Data Analysis Techniques

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: 
This involves handling missing worths, outliers, as well as inconsistencies in the dataset. Techniques including imputation for missing data and also normalization for consistent scaling are actually applied.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
EDA is actually carried out to understand the distribution of the data, identify patterns, as well as uncover first insights. This consists of statistical run-downs, visuals images, and also correlation analysis.
# Feature Engineering: 
New features are actually made coming from existing data to much better capture user engagement trends. As an example, time-series features might be de-rived to comprehend engagement over time.
# Machine Learning Models: 
Various machine learning algorithms are actually explored to predict course completion. Models including decision trees, random forests, and also neural networks are actually used to identify the best predictors of obvious completion.
# Model Evaluation and Validation: 
Techniques such as cross-validation and functionality metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) are made use of to evaluate the models. This makes sure that the models generalize effectively to hidden data.

# Choice of Python and Relevant Libraries

Python is actually decided on for this task due to its adaptability and also the comprehensive com-munity of public libraries offered for data analysis as well as machine learning.

# Pandas: 
Pandas isactually necessary for data control and also analysis (Zeineddineet al. 2021). It supplies data designs like DataFrames that assist in very easy handling of orga-nized data.
# NumPy: 
NumPy is actually utilized for numerical operations, offering support for big, multi-dimensional ranges and also matrices. Its assortment operations are essential for effective estimation.
# Scikit-learn: 
Scikit-learn is actually a robust machine learning collection that offers basic as well as efficient devices for data mining and data analysis. It includes various algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering, making it excellent for constructing predictive mod-els (Nilashiet al. 2022).
# Matplotlib and Seaborn:
These collections are utilized for data visualization, making it pos-sible for the production of useful and appealing graphs and also plots to assist in understand-ing data patterns and relationships.


# To Run the application follow below steps:

1) get the dataset from kaggle
2) run the python file on google colab or any other IDE
